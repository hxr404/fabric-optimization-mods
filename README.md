# About this Fork
DON'T USE THIS FORK! I just write down every optimisation mod I can find. Refer to the original Project instead.
Some of the Mods listed here, won't even work. And the list is incomplete (pull requests are welcome)
The original list is well-curated and better suited for production, thats why some mods are missing there.

# Reperak's Fabric Optimization Mods List
This repository contains an "encyclopedia" of performance-enhancing Minecraft mods for the [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net).
