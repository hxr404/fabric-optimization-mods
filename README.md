# About this Fork
I just write down every optimization mod I can find. Refer to the original Project instead.<br>
The original list is well-curated and better suited for production, thats why some experimental mods listed here are missing in the original.<br>
Some of the Mods listed here, won't work properly (or have incompatibilities). This is just a quick summary of some Optimization Mods, decide on your own wich one to use. Also, the list is incomplete (pull requests are welcome)<br>

And btw, don't waste time looking into the commit history, I'm to lazy to make it right xD (I'm using GitHub's Online Editor lol)

# Reperak's Fabric Optimization Mods List
